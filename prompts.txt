Using python, I need to develop a web-based GUI, similar to a chatbot tool (like ChatGPT). Imagine in a separate python project, I have an LLM and a so called "supervisor" which will coordinate with the LLM to send the commands and receive a response from the AI agent. I need to develop a nice, professional, and a good looking GUI that can interact with this supervisor (or my LLM). In other words, I need to develop a tool that can have an area for the user to enter his/her prompts, and receive the user inputs in that box, and similar to that of a chatbot, like ChatGPT, shows this message in the above area (in a chat bubble with a modern look and size and layout) with a timestamp below it for example, and then, if a toggle button of "thoughts" were on, also shows the thought process of the AI agent/LLM and then after the process is finished, shows the final response as well. Then the user may enter another input and samething goes on and on. The older messages go on top and the newer messages will be shown below them with the timestamp and something to separate who has generated these messages, either the user or the machine. It looks like my current "supervisor" program will generate the outputs using a "yield" in python, returning two things: output_thoughts, and final_res. Also, it needs to receive the user inputs as a string, upon pressing a "submit" button by the user. For now, you can create this functionality and later on I need to integrate this GUI into my supervisor program. I need you to also tell me how the supervisor is able to read/receive the user inputs from the GUI, when later I integrated it into my existing supervisor code. For now, you can start with some mock output_thoughts, and final_res strings, and later on we can replace them when we integrate this GUI with my existing supervisor code. I can also tell you the structure of the output_thoughts later on, but maybe we can start by a simple text. Perhaps the output_thoughts are more verbose than the final_res final response. Also, the output_thoughts come gradually, read from a "yield" in my supervisor python code. Can you help me implement this GUI tool in an easy yet good looking, professional way so that I can easily integrate it later on with my existing code and improve it later on? Do you need me to clarify anything for you? Is there anything from what I explained that you need more information on?

Ok, thanks very much. This was a good start. And I appreciate it. Maybe I should have explained some more detail. What I actually needed is a web-based GUI, that is good looking and visually attractive, to be shown to some people. I may need later on to add some logos, images, etc. to make it visually more attractive. What you created is purely using python libraries, but since I need it to be a web-based GUI, I'm not sure what tool/framework is the best option here, something that can easily be put aside the existing python code for my existing "supervisor". I leave it for you to decide. I need something that is fancy in looking/visualizing it, eye catching, with modern interfaces and features. In terms of functionality, what you implemented now is good at this step. Can you help me with this?

I'll help you create a modern, web-based GUI for your chatbot interface that can integrate with your existing Python supervisor code. Given your requirements for a visually attractive, professional-looking web interface, I'll use Streamlit - it's perfect for this use case as it:

Creates beautiful web interfaces with minimal code
Integrates seamlessly with Python backend code
Supports real-time updates and streaming
Has modern UI components out of the box
Easy to deploy and customize
Let me create a comprehensive solution for you:

Updated todo list
Updated todo list
Updated todo list and ran terminal command
Perfect! I've created a comprehensive, modern web-based chatbot GUI for you using Streamlit. Here's what I've built:

üöÄ What You Get
Modern Web Interface
Beautiful gradient styling with professional appearance
Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
Real-time chat interface similar to ChatGPT
Sidebar with settings and statistics
Toggle for showing/hiding AI thoughts
Key Features
üí≠ Thought Process Visualization: Shows AI thinking steps when enabled
‚ö° Real-time Streaming: Updates as your supervisor yields responses
üìä Chat Statistics: Tracks message counts and conversation metrics
üé® Professional Styling: Modern gradients, hover effects, and clean layout
üì± Mobile-Friendly: Responsive design that works everywhere
Easy Integration
Your existing supervisor just needs to implement a process_input method that yields tuples:

def process_input(self, user_input: str) -> Generator[Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]], None, None]:
    # Yield thoughts: (thought_text, None)
    yield ("Analyzing request...", None)
    
    # Yield final response: (None, final_response)
    yield (None, "Here's my response")
üìÅ Files Created
chatbot_gui.py - Main Streamlit application with modern styling
mock_supervisor.py - Mock supervisor that simulates your yield-based system
integration_example.py - Complete examples showing how to integrate your existing code
requirements.txt - Dependencies (Streamlit + supporting libraries)
README.md - Comprehensive documentation and integration guide
üîß How to Integrate Your Supervisor
Quick Integration Steps:
Test the Mock: Run streamlit run chatbot_gui.py to see it working
Adapt Your Code: Add a process_input method to your supervisor that yields (thought, None) for thoughts and (None, response) for final responses
Replace Import: Change from mock_supervisor import MockSupervisor to your actual supervisor
Deploy: Run on local network or deploy to web
Integration Pattern:
# Your existing supervisor becomes:
class YourSupervisor:
    def process_input(self, user_input: str):
        # Your existing logic with yield statements
        yield ("Starting analysis...", None)
        
        # Your LLM processing
        for thought in your_llm_thinking_process(user_input):
            yield (thought, None)
        
        # Final response
        final_response = your_existing_method(user_input)
        yield (None, final_response)
üé® Customization Ready
The interface is designed to be easily customizable:

Add your logo in the header
Change colors by modifying CSS gradients
Add custom widgets in the sidebar
Implement authentication for production use
Deploy to cloud with Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or custom servers
üåê Web-Based Benefits
Unlike traditional Python GUI libraries, this Streamlit solution gives you:

Professional web interface that looks modern and attractive
Easy deployment - can be accessed from any browser
Cross-platform compatibility - works on any device
Easy customization - simple HTML/CSS modifications
Scalable architecture - easy to add features and deploy
The application is now running in the background and should be accessible at http://localhost:8501. You can test it immediately with the mock supervisor, then follow the integration guide to connect your existing code.

Would you like me to show you how to customize any specific aspects (like adding your logo, changing colors, or modifying the layout) or help you with the integration process for your existing supervisor code?
